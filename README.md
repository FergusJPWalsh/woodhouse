# Woodhouse English-Greek Dictionary

This poject aims to be a small client-side search page for Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary. The University of Chicago Library kindly hosts a search interface [here](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/Woodhouse/), but this aims to be a little faster, simpler, and easier.

*Data source*: The Lingvo DSL dictionary [available here](http://www.textkit.com/greek-latin-forum/viewtopic.php?t=62713) was converted to CSV with [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary).
